### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tamas Marki. I am a ***Political Scientist***, ***Humanitarian***, and a ***Web Developer***.

Currently, I work as a Delegate of the Danish Red Cross in Nepal. I manage a project funded by the European Commission. 

> ðŸ‘‰ We work on developing and testing concepts of **anticipatory action**, which means that using weather forecasts and other scientific prediction tools we engage local authorities to warn communities in advance of impending hazards such as riverine floods so that they can take action. It's pretty cool stuff, check out some of our achievements posted on [anticipation-hub.org](https://www.anticipation-hub.org/experience/anticipatory-action-in-the-world/nepal/forecast-based-action-and-shock-responsive-social-protection-in-nepal)!

As a Programmer, I enjoy creating small productivity apps, to both:

* ðŸ˜Ž make my day job easier 
* ðŸ¤– and entertain the techie side of my brain 

I'm mainly working on PWAs using **JavaScript** (also JSX & **React**), styling with CSS (also **Sass**). Check out [DraftBudget](https://github.com/tmrk/DraftBudget) (Vanilla JS) and [EttEn.app](https://github.com/tmrk/EttEnApp) (React) for example!

I have also dabbled in **C#** while doing a Full Stack course mainly focusing on console apps including EntityFramework and Migrations, etc. Check out [this excercise](https://github.com/tmrk/Asset-Tracking-with-EntityFramework) for example.
